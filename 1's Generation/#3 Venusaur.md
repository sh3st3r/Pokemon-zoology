Biology

Venusaur is a squat, quadrupedal amphibian Pokémon with bumpy, blue-green skin. It has small, circular red eyes and a short, blunt snout. Its mouth is wide with two pointed teeth in the upper jaw and four in the lower jaw. On top of its head are small, pointed ears with reddish-pink insides. It has three clawed toes on each foot. The bud on its back has bloomed into a large pink, white-spotted flower. The flower is supported by a thick, brown trunk surrounded by green fronds. A female Venusaur has a seed in the center of its flower.

Venusaur uses its flower to catch the sun's rays to convert them into energy, which causes the flower to become more vibrant. The flower releases a soothing scent that attracts Pokémon and calms emotions. This scent becomes stronger after a rainy day. Venusaur is at its strongest in the summertime when there is much more sunlight to absorb. As shown in Pokémon Sleep, Venusaur releases a soothing fragrance while sleeping.In the anime, Venusaur has demonstrated the ability to manipulate nature, release several vines from its back, and lead evolution ceremonies for Bulbasaur and Ivysaur. This Pokémon is rarely found in the wild, but it has been known to inhabit grasslands.

Biology

Charmander is a bipedal, reptilian Pokémon with a primarily orange body and blue eyes. Its underside from the chest down and the soles of its feet are cream-colored. It has two small fangs visible in its upper jaw and two smaller fangs in its lower jaw. A fire burns at the tip of this Pokémon's slender tail and has blazed there since Charmander's birth.

The flame can be used as an indication of Charmander's health and mood, burning brightly when the Pokémon is strong, weakly when it is exhausted, wavering when it is happy, and blazing when it is enraged. It is said that Charmander would die if its flame were to go out. However, if the Pokémon is healthy, the flame will continue to burn even if it gets a bit wet and is said to steam in the rain. As shown in Pokémon Sleep, Charmander is known to sleep while curled up. Supposedly, Charmander is drawing warmth from the flame on its tail. During quiet nights, one can hear the sound of a flame burning if you listen hard enough while Charmander sleeps.

Theory :
Charamanders lives in group in volcanic area and in places where it rain very little as rain can be fatal for them.It is a natural instinc to fear water and especially rain.However if it dizzles u can possibly see them outside and see some steam coming out near their tail.
They protect each others flames and their flame allow us to see their mental state and their vitality
If you are attacked by one of these pokemon spray some water on their tail and it will make them flee, be carefull though as putting too much water might kill them.

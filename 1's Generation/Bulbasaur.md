Biology (from bulbagarden) :

Bulbasaur is a small, quadrupedal amphibian Pok√©mon that has blue-green skin with darker patches. It has red eyes with white pupils, pointed, ear-like structures on top of its head, and a short, blunt snout with a wide mouth. A pair of small, pointed teeth are visible in the upper jaw when its mouth is open. Each of its thick legs ends with three sharp claws. On Bulbasaur's back is a green plant bulb that conceals two slender, tentacle-like vines, which is grown from a seed planted there at birth. The bulb also provides it with energy through photosynthesis as well as from the nutrient-rich seeds contained within.

Theory:

It is herbivorous
Like most plant it also likes the rain 
Bulbasaur is a pretty calm pokemon and spend the vast majority of his time in the plain at places where it can catch the most of the sun.
His bulb will grow as bulbasaur absorb nutriments and past a certain point it the bulb size it will evolve into ivysaur. 
Will use his vines to catch fruit and vegetable at certain height or to help him climb to certain places where it can't go

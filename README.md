# Pokemon-zoology
A sort of pokedex describing pokemon behaviors if they were to be in the real world

Objectives :
- [ ]  Make a Description and short analyse on how pokemon of the 1's generation would interact with their environment
- [ ]  Add Information about skills and talents and how it affects their lives
- [ ]  TBD

This project is open to everyone as i've got very little  knowledge about pokemon but just thought it could be interesting to see how they would interact in a realistic way eg bee-like pokemon being used as a way of reproduction for plant based pokemon, real strenght and weakness of pokemon, how they interact with their environment, how they live etc..

I'm pretty new when it comes to github so i'm also open to any help on how to inprove presentation and all.
